# **Titanic Survival Prediction**

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is a well-known tragedy, and this project aims to predict whether a given passenger would have survived based on various attributes.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the famous `"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"` dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It consists of two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `train.csv` file contains the training data with known labels (survived or not), while the `test.csv` file contains the test data without labels, which are to be predicted by the trained model.
